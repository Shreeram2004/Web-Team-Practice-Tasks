/*
Basic Javascript Concepts: Arrays and Objects

Task:
	1. Using the `forEach` method on `accountSheet`, set a named value `expenditure` in each object.
	The value of the `expenditure` is `100 - balance`

	2. Using the `filter` and `map` methods, display an array of the names of those in `accountSheet`
	who have a balance greater than or equal to `50`.

	3. Using the spread operator, create objects for each broke member and add them to the account sheet.

	4. Display the array `accountSheet` after sorting iton the basis of
		a. remaining balance (increasing order)
		b. alphabetical order of name (in case of equal balance)

	5. Using `find` method, display the name of the person with the balance `94`

	6. Display the index of `Goose` in the accountSheet sorted solely based on the alphabetical order of name.

Note: Your submissions must use array and object methods
