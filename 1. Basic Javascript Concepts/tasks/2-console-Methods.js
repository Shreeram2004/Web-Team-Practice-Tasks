Basic Javascript Concepts: console Methods

Task:
	1. Uncomment the `console.log` statement and note the observations of the output.
	2. Commment `console.log` and uncomment the `console.dir` statement. Note how the output is different in both cases.
	3. Uncomment `console.clear` and repeat the exercise. Note what changes in both cases.

// Edit the code beyond this point.

//  console.clear();

/*
If we uncomment `console.clear`, it will clear the console . But it should be written after `console.log` and `console.dir`	
*/

// console.log(family);

/*
We can see the Javascript object "family" in console
*/

//console.dir(family, { depth: null });

/*
We can see the nested Javascript object "family" in console in detail
